# this is my assessments of Getting and cleaning  data

##1.background
    One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computingï¼ŒCompanies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up 
are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data 
collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.


##2.the purpose of the project
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject


##3.my assements
###including:
1.run_analysis.R(it is the whole program  with fully annotations)
2.merged_data(it's the tidy data through getting and cleaning the origin data, it's based on the  first four of purpose of the project)
3.data_with_means.txt(it's about the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.)
